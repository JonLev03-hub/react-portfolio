# Starter React Portfolio

When moving into web-development it is standard to have a web portfolio to display your work. To ensure that I can showcase my skills I have designed and created a web portfolio. This web portfolio was designed with a free wireframe software on micro.com, then the side was built with react.js.

This portfolio was designed to have a minimalist feel but still accurately depict the work I have done. I included multiple sections where you can learn information about me and at the bottom there is a projects section where you can view some of the wor I have made. 

## Projects section
Inside this projects section there is a side scroller where you can view different cards displaying projects, and on focus they will expand giving more information on the project, what I have done in that project, and what problems I had run into.

This portfolio is a good project But it still has room for improvement. I would love to add more use of images to the site and keep the simple design. I would also love to add more animation into the website so it is more visually stimulating.
