# Starter React Portfolio

When moving into web-development it is standard to have a web portfolio to display your work. To ensure that I can showcase my skills I have designed and created a web portfolio. This web portfolio was designed with a free wireframe software on micro.com, then the side was built with react.js. 

The code is not final as this project is still a work in progress. The current site effectively displays your projects but it has some faults that need addressed. To follow that anything can be better with proper decoration. 

Current features in development 
1. More Information on projects through card decks.
2. Pages switching on scroll
3. Resume display area inside of front page
4. update bio and skills
